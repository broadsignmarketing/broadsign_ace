> Using programmatic DOOH to reach 1m+ viewers

## Challenge

While foodora is popular for delivery, the brand’s pick-up option isn’t as well-known.

## Audience

Busy business people

## Solution

A creative campaign that delivered custom messages based on weather and the geolocation of each sign. The campaign was bought and managed by foodora’s in-house digital media team using OutMoove DSP and ECN screens.

## Results

3X lift in pick-up sales for key locations
