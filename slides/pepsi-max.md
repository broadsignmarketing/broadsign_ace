> Retargeting fans with programmatic DOOH

## Pepsi's Challenge

Create a multi-channel campaign to reach participants of the Pepsi Taste Challenge when they are later shopping.

## Audience

Participants in the Pepsi Taste Challenge in The Netherlands

## Solution

Using a mobile app and beacon technology, Omnicom and Platform161 created a hyper-targeted programmatic DOOH campaign that triggered instantly in select malls when a Taste Test participant entered the mall. The moment the ad was triggered, the entire mall network displayed the Pepsi MAX ad takeover.

## Campaign Partners

Omnicom, Pepsi, Platform161, Exterion Media, Broadsign
